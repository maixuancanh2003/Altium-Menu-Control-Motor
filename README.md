## ðŸš€ Getting Started
To begin using the **Menu-Control-Motor** board:
1. Open the Altium Designer 21 project file (`.PrjPcb`) to explore or modify the design.
2. Program the ATMEGA328P with firmware for motor control.
3. Connect the board to your motor setup and power supply.
4. Use the menu interface to control motor parameters and test functionality.

## ðŸ›  Usage Examples
1. **Motor Speed Control**: Adjust the motor speed via PWM signals.
2. **Directional Control**: Change motor rotation direction using the digital output pins.
3. **Menu Navigation**: Use buttons or a rotary encoder to navigate through the menu options for fine-tuning motor performance.
